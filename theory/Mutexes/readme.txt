What to Understand About Mutexes
Mutexes (pthread_mutex_t) are essential for managing shared resources in multithreaded applications. Hereâ€™s what you should grasp:

Purpose of Mutexes

Prevent race conditions, ensuring only one thread accesses a shared resource at a time.

Synchronize critical sections of your code where multiple threads might compete.

Basic Mutex Operations

Initialize: pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);

Lock: pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex); (Thread enters critical section.)

Unlock: pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex); (Thread releases the resource.)

Destroy: pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex); (Clean up when done.)

Using Mutexes with Shared Data

Any global/shared variables need to be protected with a mutex to prevent unexpected modifications.

Example: If multiple threads are updating a counter, without a mutex, data corruption can occur.

Granularity of Locking

Only lock when absolutely necessary; excessive locking can slow down performance.

Keep the critical section (the portion of code inside pthread_mutex_lock) as short as possible.

Practical Use in the Philosophers Project

Each fork should be protected by a mutex (pthread_mutex_t).

Philosophers must lock both forks before eating and unlock them after.

Proper order of locking prevents potential deadlocks.
